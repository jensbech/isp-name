# Publishing to Homebrew - Single Repository Approach

## Simple Method: Everything in One Repo

Your repository can serve as both the source code AND a Homebrew tap. No need for a separate repository!

### 1. Structure (Already Set Up)
```
isp-name/
├── Formula/
│   └── isp-org-menubar-app.rb    # Homebrew formula
├── Sources/
├── scripts/build-release.sh
└── release/                       # Generated releases
```

### 2. Create GitHub Release
```bash
# 1. Commit your current changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add Homebrew formula and release structure"
git push origin main

# 2. Create a GitHub release:
# - Go to: https://github.com/jensbech/isp-name/releases
# - Click "Create a new release"
# - Tag: v1.0.0
# - Upload: release/ISPOrgMenuBarApp-1.0.0-arm64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
# - Publish release
```

### 3. Users Install Directly From Your Repo
```bash
# Install directly from your repository
brew install jensbech/isp-name/isp-org-menubar-app

# Or add as a tap first, then install
brew tap jensbech/isp-name
brew install isp-org-menubar-app
```

### 4. For Future Releases
```bash
# Update version
./scripts/build-release.sh 1.1.0

# Update Formula/isp-org-menubar-app.rb with new version and SHA
# Create new GitHub release
# Push changes
```

## How It Works

When you run `brew tap jensbech/isp-name`, Homebrew:
1. Clones your repository 
2. Looks for the `Formula/` directory
3. Makes all `.rb` files in `Formula/` available as packages

This is much simpler than managing a separate `homebrew-tap` repository!

## Option 2: Submit to homebrew/core (More complex, requires review)

### Requirements for homebrew/core:
- Stable, well-maintained software
- Notable/popular enough for inclusion
- Meets all Homebrew guidelines
- Must pass automated testing

### Process:
1. Create the same release as above
2. Fork https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core
3. Add your formula to `Formula/isp-org-menubar-app.rb`
4. Submit a pull request
5. Address reviewer feedback
6. Wait for approval and merge

## Option 3: Homebrew Cask (For .app bundles)

If you want to distribute as a .app bundle instead of a command-line binary:

1. Create an .app bundle (more complex, requires additional packaging)
2. Submit to homebrew/cask instead
3. Cask formulae are for GUI applications distributed as .app bundles

## Quick Start (Your Tap)

```bash
# 1. Build release
./scripts/build-release.sh 1.0.0

# 2. Create GitHub release and upload tarball

# 3. Create homebrew-tap repository with the generated formula

# 4. Users can then install with:
brew tap jensbech/tap
brew install isp-org-menubar-app
```

## Tips
- Start with your own tap - it's much easier
- Test thoroughly before publishing
- Keep your formula updated with new releases
- Consider adding a `brew test` command that actually works
- Document any special requirements or setup steps
